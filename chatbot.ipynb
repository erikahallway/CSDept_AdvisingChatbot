      "* The Department of Computer Science at Texas Tech University provides an excellent environment for furthering your studies. There are 18 faculty members, with research specialties across the entire spectrum of computer science. You can view the different research groups here (https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/research/index.php) or you can view our individual faculty member pages here (https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/). Our department offers five different graduate programs: Master of Science in Computer Science, Master of Science in Software and Security Engineering, Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science, Graduate Certificate in Software Engineering, Graduate Certificate in Security. We also offer combined Bachelor's and Master's programs, i.e., the 150-hour combined or accelerated BS/M.S. programs. We offer two combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science programs. In both cases, completion of the degree requirements leads to the awarding of two degrees. In one, the degrees awarded are the Computer Science BS and the Master of Science in Computer Science; in the other, the degrees are the Computer Science BS and the Master of Science in Software and Security Engineering. Depending on the options of the master's programs, the combined programs allow dual counts of up to nine credits. Students choosing the combined degree program would be admitted initially as pursuing a Computer Science BS. The graduate component of the program would be added upon admission to the master's degree. Accepted students can begin taking their graduate courses during their senior year. Students must be admitted to the graduate program before enrolling in graduate-level courses. These programs provide a strong background in computer science, specialization in subject tracks, and opportunities for research. A vast array of modern computing facilities are provided for graduate students. The on-campus High Performance Computing Center (HPCC) houses several high−performance computer systems, along with a panoramic theater for graphic and visualization demonstrations. Our graduates have been employed in many top companies including Microsoft, Meta, LinkedIn, Amazon, Google, Apple, Oracle, VMware, HPE, Nvidia, Dell, Adobe, IBM, NASA, as well as in banking industry, investment firms, and other industry sectors. Our PhD graduates have joined tier-one research universities and teaching universities as professors and national laboratories as research scientists. Our graduates are also successful in entrepreneurship and creating their own businesses.\n",
